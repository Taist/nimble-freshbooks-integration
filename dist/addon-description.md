Addon allows to create FreshBooks estimates directly from Nimble Deal with one click and display them inside Nimble.

** Setting up the addon: ** 
After enabling the addon, open FreshBooks, go to "My Account -> FreshBooks API" - a large button "Enable integration with Nimble" will appear (see screenshot 1). Press it.

** Using the addon: **

1. Open a deal in Nimble
2. Check that the deal is linked to a contact person
3. Press "Create estimate" link under the deal fields:
   * a new client will be created in Freshbooks (it will be associated with the contact person in Nimble to be used in next estimates for the same contact person)
   * a new estimate will be created in FreshBooks and opened for editing
4. Fill and save the estimate
5. Switch to Nimble, reopen the deal - the estimate will be displayed inside the deal
  

** To be done: **

* improved UI
* updating deal amount from estimate total
* searching for existing client in Freshbooks that matches contact person from Nimble
* copying the estimate to clipboard to paste it easily into any document
* refreshing estimate
